## Using hledger

### General Usage

### General Structure

```console
.
â”œâ”€â”€ 2024
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ aliased.ledger
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ book.ledger
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ postings.ledger
â”œâ”€â”€ book.ledger
â””â”€â”€ meta
    â”œâ”€â”€ coicop-2018.ledger
    â””â”€â”€ commodities.ledger
```

`book.ledger`

- Main entry point for the general ledger, or each year's ledger

`postings.ledger`

- Actual double-entry transactions
- should __**always**__ pass `--strict`
- should optimally __**always**__ pass all checks

`aliased.ledger`

- Because of how `hledger` works, we create a separate file to handle aliases
- This should provide a more readable `accounts` output

### Checking that any year's book passes strict checks

`hledger bal --strict -f 2024/book.ledger`

### Checking that any year's book passes all checks

`hledger check --strict ordereddates payees tags recentassertions
uniqueleafnames -f 2024/book.ledger`

## Using Git-Agecrypt

[Git-agecrypt](https://github.com/vlaci/git-agecrypt) is a rust-written file
encryption `git` extension.

`git-agecrypt` allows one to upload files to public platforms (or platforms
where privacy is not guaranteed, such as private repos) in an encrypted manner.

For the purposes of this example, a pair of Ed25519 private-public keys is
provided in `secrets`.

However in your own version you should not at all consider providing this
key-pair publicly.

Please refer to the git-agecrypt documentation.

### ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT

For encryption to occur the file needs to:

- ðŸš¨ Have recipients detailed in `git-agecrypt.toml`
- ðŸš¨ Be filtered and diffed by `git-agecrypt` in `.gitattributes`

### Note on decrypting

The `git-agecrypt` docs are not amazing.

To decrypt files after cloning, add an identity.

For example: `git-agecrypt config add -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519`.

This identity needs to be a recipient of the particular files you want decrypted.

Then, to decrypt run `git checkout HEAD -- .`

For example, in this repo:

```console
git-agecrypt config add -i $"($env.PWD)/secrets/id_ed25519"
git checkout HEAD -- .
```

This does not need to be done ever again, as `git pull` will automatically
decrypt the file in the future.
