# Accounting Example

## Using Git-Agerypt

https://github.com/vlaci/git-agecrypt

`git-agecrypt` allows one to upload files to public platforms (or platforms where privacy is not guaranteed, such as private repos) in an encrypted manner.

Locally, decrypting is easy.

For the purposes of this example, a pair of Ed25519 private-public keys is provided..

However in your own version you should not at all consider providing this keypair publicly.

Please refer to the git-agecrypt documentation at their github repo.
